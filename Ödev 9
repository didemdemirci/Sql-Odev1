1)
select  country,city from country
inner join city on city.country_id= country.country_id
order by country.country;

burada yalnızca order by country desek de olur

2)
select payment_id, first_name, last_name from customer 
inner join payment on customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id;

Eğer her müşterinin payment_id'lerini sıralamak istersek: 

SELECT first_name, last_name, STRING_AGG(payment_id::TEXT, ', ') AS payment_ids
FROM customer
INNER JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;

3)
SELECT first_name, last_name, rental_id 
FROM customer
INNER JOIN rental ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
