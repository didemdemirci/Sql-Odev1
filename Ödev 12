ya da 

select customer.first_name, customer.last_name, count(distinct payment_id) as alisveris_sayisi from customer join payment on
customer.customer_id=payment.customer_id
group by customer.first_name, customer.last_name
having count(distinct payment_id)=(SELECT MAX(alisveris_sayisi)
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT payment_id) AS alisveris_sayisi
        FROM payment
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )as subquery );

alışveriş adeti değil de haracanan tutar üzerinden olsaydı:

select customer.first_name, customer.last_name, sum(payment.amount) as tutar from customer join payment on
customer.customer_id=payment.customer_id
group by customer.first_name, customer.last_name
having sum(amount)=(SELECT MAX(tutar) 
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, sum(amount) AS tutar
        FROM payment
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )as subquery );
